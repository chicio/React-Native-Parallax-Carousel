# React native parallax carousel

This is an example app created with [Expo](https://expo.dev) for the blog post ["Create a circular carousel with parallax effect
in React Native"](https://www.fabrizioduroni.it/2024/12/31/carousel-parallax-circular-loop-react-native-expo/).
In this blog post, I show how it is possible to create a full-screen carousel with:

* parallax animation on the images inside the items during scroll
* opacity animation on the text label during scroll
* circular carousel: infinite scroll with item show in a loop

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
